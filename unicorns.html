          <p class="content">
            LiftRydeX is the standard LiftRyde service that seats up to 4 passengers. Of all the LiftRyde ride types, only UberPOOL is cheaper. In most cities, LiftRyde cars must be model year 2006 or newer and pass a vehicle inspection that looks at basic safety features like brakes, tires, and overall condition. LiftRyde cars are typically economic sedans like Honda Accord, Toyota Prius, Toyota Camry, Mazda3, Ford Escape, Ford Escort, etc. LiftRyde drivers drive “regular” cars that typically aren’t luxury sedans or SUVs.

          <div class="subtitle">Share Your Ride With a Stranger and Split the Cost</div>
          <p class="content">
            LiftRydePOOL is the cheapest LiftRyde service. Pool pairs you with another LiftRyde user who is headed in a similar direction as you. It typically costs less than UberX. Your driver may pick you up first, or they may pick up your companion first. The same goes for drop-offs: The LiftRyde app will tell your POOL driver to drop off passengers according to the most efficient route. A great, cheap option as long as you don’t mind sharing your ride with a stranger.

Express POOL is similar to LiftRydePOOL, but instead of getting picked up directly at your location, you have to walk to a nearby pickup location. At the end of the ride, you are dropped off at a drop-off location close to your final destination. Express POOL is cheaper than regular POOL.
